# a-simple-drum
As I am learning web development based on London App Brewery, I built this interactive drum kit website as part of my assignment.


Features Implemented:
âœ” JavaScript Functionality:

Click & Key Events: Users can play drum sounds using mouse clicks and keyboard keys.
Sound Effects: The key pressed (w, a, s, d, j, k, l) triggers different drum sounds.
Animations: Added visual feedback with a "pressed" effect when a key is played.
Timeout Function: Ensures the button animation effect lasts for a short duration.
âœ” CSS Modifications:

Responsive Design: Improved the layout for mobile devices with flexible styling.
Gradient Background Animation: Added a smooth, modern background transition.
Neon Glow Effect: Implemented hover and pressed effects on buttons.
Backdrop Blur: Drum buttons now have a glass effect for a more polished look.
I completely modify JS & CSS to enhance usability and design. ðŸš€ðŸŽ¶
